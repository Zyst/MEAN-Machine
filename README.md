##MEAN-Machine
The people over at [scotch.io](scotch.io) who have some amazing tutorials made this [book](https://leanpub.com/mean-machine).

I have always been a huge fan of the website, when I saw they had a book I instantly bought it.

Although it may be at a slow pace because of work-stuff I'm planning on dropping the book 'course work' here.

Everything in the book has code samples in [this git](https://github.com/scotch-io/mean-machine-code) and that itself is distributed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
