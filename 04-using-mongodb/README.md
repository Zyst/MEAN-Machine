Not much went on, I setup a MongoLab account so this could be used by anyone _(Please don't drop the tables)_

Login:

To connect using the shell:

    mongo ds055680.mongolab.com:55680/mean-machine -u <dbuser> -p <dbpassword>

To connect using a driver via the standard URI:

    mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds055680.mongolab.com:55680/mean-machine

**Username:** meanmachine

**Password:** scotch
